# Transporter

Transporter is an RPC protocol and library for distributed computing in TypeScript. Transporter is designed to work in any JavaScript runtime. The Transporter API was influenced by [comlink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink) and [rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs).

You may use Transporter to,

- Create APIs for fullstack TypeScript applications.
- Communicate with sub frames, including cross-origin frames, in a browsing context.
- Communicate with dedicated workers, shared workers, and service workers in a browsing context.
- Synchronize state between open browser tabs.
- Communicate with an embedded webview within a React Native application.

These are just some examples of what Transporter can do.
